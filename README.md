# Newark Airport Delays WIP
This project will analyze flight delays at Newark airport during 2024 from four airlines, Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines. This data was downladed from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ontime/Departures.aspx). 

Please click on the jupyter notebook and Github will create a preview of my work. 

This project is currently a work in progress so check back up periodically!
